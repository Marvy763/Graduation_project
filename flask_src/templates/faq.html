                <p>Lung cancer is caused by abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in either one or both of the lungs.

There are two main sub-classifications of primary lung cancer:

1. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) – this is the most common form of lung cancer, making up approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. NSCLC can be classified into a number of types, including:
1.1 Adenocarcinoma – typically found on the outer area of the lungs, in cells that produce mucus
1.2 Squamous cell carcinoma – typically found in the airways of the lungs
1.3 Large cell undifferentiated carcinoma – this type of cancer can not be classified as either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.
2. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) – this type of lung cancer tends to spread faster than NSCLC, however it is less common than NSCLC, accounting for approximately 15% of all lung cancers.</p>

              <dt><a href="#" class="accordionTitle">Is lung cancer hereditary?</a></dt>
              <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
                <p>For most lung cancer cases, genetic mutations are somatic (meaning they happen in cells only specific to that individual and are not inherited).

In rare cases, genetics may play a role in the development of lung cancer, particularly for people who have inherited gene mutations on chromosome 6 (which accounts for approximately 6% of all DNA in cells).

However the most common cause of lung cancer is cigarette smoking. </p>

              <dt><a href="#" class="accordionTitle">Are there risk factors for lung cancer?</a></dt>
              <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
                <p>Exact causes of lung cancer are not fully known, especially in those people who develop lung cancer without any known risk factors. 

However, there are a number of lifestyle-related factors which increase the risk of developing lung cancer, including: 

Smoking – cigarette smoking carries a significantly higher risk of developing lung cancer when compared with non-smokers. It is estimated that lung cancer cases as a result of cigarette smoking contribute to 90% of all cases in men and 65% in women. 
Second-hand smoking – there is an increased risk for non-smoking people who breath in the cigarette smoke of others. Living with someone who smokes can increase your risk for lung cancer by approximately 20-30%. 
Additional risk factors include:

Age – the risk of developing lung cancer increases as people age. Most lung cancers are diagnosed in people over the age of 60.
Medical history – for people who have a medical history of lung disease such as emphysema or fibrosis of the lung may have an increased risk of developing lung cancer.
